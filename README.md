## 📌 Project Overview
- This project analyses student.csv database using Python
## 🎯 Objectives
- The goal is to be able to define the purpose and advantages of using Python in programming

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
-	Python


## 🔍 Key Steps in Analysis
- First, we have to mount the drive to Google Collaboratory and run it

  - Once mounted, we have been demonstrating several codes to clean and manipulate the db.
  -  Below are examples of the tasks we did,
    
### Loading and Exploring the Data
1.	Question: "Write the code to read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame."
2.	Question: "Write the code to display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame."
3.	Question: "Write the code to get the information about the DataFrame."
4.	Question: "Write the code to get summary statistics for the DataFrame."

### Indexing and Slicing
1.	Question: "Write the code to select the 'name' column."
2.	Question: "Write the code to select the 'name' and 'mark' columns."
3.	Question: "Write the code to select the first 3 rows."
4.	Question: "Write the code to select all rows where the 'class' is 'Four'."
### Data Manipulation
1.	Question: "Write the code to add a new column 'passed' that indicates whether the student passed (mark >= 60)."
2.	Question: "Write the code to rename the 'mark' column to 'score'."
3.	Question: "Write the code to drop the 'passed' column."

### Aggregation and Grouping
1.	Question: "Write the code to group the DataFrame by the 'class' column and calculate the mean 'mark' for each group."
2.	Question: "Write the code to count the number of students in each class."
3.	Question: "Write the code to calculate the average mark for each gender."
